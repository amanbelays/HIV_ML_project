# HIV_ML_project


Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) remains a critical public health challenge globally, with sub-Saharan Africa bearing a disproportionate share of the burden. Among the countries in this region, Ethiopia has made significant strides in combating the epidemic, yet the prevalence and impact of HIV/AIDS continue to pose severe health and socio-economic challenges. Key to mitigating the spread and impact of HIV is the promotion and adoption of regular HIV testing practices, particularly among reproductive-age women, who represent a crucial demographic both in terms of transmission dynamics and public health intervention.

Despite extensive efforts to increase awareness and availability of HIV testing services, numerous barriers still hinder optimal testing rates among Ethiopian women of reproductive age. These barriers are multifaceted, encompassing socio-economic, cultural, and educational factors, as well as accessibility and perceived stigma associated with testing. Understanding these factors and predicting the likelihood of testing practices can provide valuable insights for targeted interventions and policy-making.

The Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) conducted in Ethiopia in 2019 offers a comprehensive dataset that captures a wide array of variables pertinent to HIV testing behaviors. Leveraging this rich dataset, machine learning techniques present a powerful analytical approach to uncover patterns, relationships, and predictors of HIV testing among reproductive-age women.

This ML project aims to utilize machine learning algorithms to predict HIV testing practices among reproductive-age women in Ethiopia, drawing on the 2019 DHS data. By identifying key predictors and constructing robust predictive models, the project seeks to inform and enhance public health strategies, ensuring more effective targeting of resources and interventions to those most in need.
